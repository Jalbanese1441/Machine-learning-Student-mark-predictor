# Machine-learning-Student-mark-predictor
This is the first machine learning program that I ever made. It was for a CCA in school, it can predict a student’s mark based off of past marks and other information. Please see the readme file for more information. This program may have a few things that don’t make a tone of sense but I needed to include them to get full marks on my CCA ( Course Culminating Activity). Also, I tired to remove all notes I made to my teacher but a few may still be in the code. I have built in an installer, so it is easier to run. Also, I will not be updating this program.
